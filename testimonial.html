From the very beginning, he was genuinely invested in the process and really listened, translating my ideas about tone, feel, and aesthetic into something even more beautiful and alive than I had imagined.

                            The instrument has a warmth and character that feels deeply personal, and every detail reflects the care and craftsmanship he puts into his work. This banjo is a piece of art and will be a lifelong instrument. I am so grateful for the care he put into bringing it to life and could not recommend working with him more highly."

                        The result was great! The banjo has a beautiful sound and is wonderful to play. My feelings about it are echoed by other players too — I’ve lent it out to several friends over the years, and it’s sparked a lot of enthusiasm for his work."</i></p>

It brings forward sounds that are both earthy and bright, both punchy and smooth, and I find it easy to be expressive and playful on the instrument. <br> <br>I had tried a few of Alex’s banjos before this one and loved them all, so I was thrilled when he decided to build this one. We brainstormed the possibilities, and Alex helped me understand different design and build ideas so that we could shape my dream banjo together. <br> <br>Throughout the process, Alex shared the creative journey with me. I got to witness a beautiful piece of art being made, and now I get to make music with that very piece. I’m truly grateful both for the experience and all the music to come from Little Red."</i></p>

                            He was open to our ideas about how we wanted it to look and feel. We even got to help choose the hardware and the inlay design on the head. We love the tone and playability of the instrument. It’s an open-back 17-fret tenor banjo with a mellow, warm sound that suits us perfectly."
